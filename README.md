# Concrete-Abstractions
I tried to learn Scheme (lisp dialect) around 2014 and I tried SICP but I found it too difficult.  
I was looking around and this [blog](https://jaortega.wordpress.com/2007/01/31/a-scheme-bookshelf/) recommended an easier alternative called Concrete Abstraction.  
More information about the textbook can be found [here](https://gustavus.edu/academics/departments/mathematics-computer-science-and-statistics/max/concrete-abstractions.html)  
I also added the pdf into the repo.  

This repo is my attempts at some of the exercises in the book.  
I used DrRacket to edit and run the exercises.  
I also used the [sicp](https://docs.racket-lang.org/sicp-manual/Installation.html) package as the language in DrRacket.
